# crypto-portfolio-data-engineering-project
In this project, I develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using the CryptoCompare API on Azure Cloud Services. The goal is to construct crypto portfolios tailored to investors' requirements, such as minimizing variance, while leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory principles. This project also analyzes a News Sentiment Index from the data and incorporates the index into the portfolio. Finally, various data visualizations will be presented.

Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
